Things desired in Webmin core that would make theme development much easier
and faster, and would allow us to achieve cool new things. Numbers are the
guesstimated difficulty out of 10 and time to implement in days.

4/3   - header function consolidation and simplification.

9/30  - Removal of tables from all of Webmin's ui-lib, except when presenting
        tabular data. Convert to much simpler CSS components, striving for 
        semantic meaning when possible.

6/15  - Remove piecemeal JavaScript and replace with code in index.js or a
        library file. Use jQuery to reduce size and complexity. Current
        code is error-prone and triggers failures in AJAX apps (causing
        the JavaScript to stop, which prevents events from being attached).

10/60 - Convert pages into discrete components, so that tables of data can be
        updated in realtime and/or independently from the rest of the page.
 
8/30  - Make it possible to get JSON out of tabular data sources. i.e. a
        MySQL table should be able to be updated in realtime and without
        having to redraw the whole table. Depends on previous item, at least
        for the modules that need this ability.

5/30  - ui-lib simplification. I dunno exactly what this means, but my theme
        functions are vastly shorter than the equivalent ui-lib functions, in
        almost every case. It'd be wise to standardize on those and merge them
        down to the core ui-lib, modernizing the codebase, and simplfiying
        future development. It breaks backward compatibility, probably
        and requires Jamie to work with CSS rather than tables on everything 
        in the future.
